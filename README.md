# Strong's 9618 paper4 codes in python
These are my codes for caie alevel 9618 paper 4s

I am an Outstanding Cambridge Learner of 9618

I create this repository because CAIE doesn't provide python answer codes as a whole file

Also, there are errors(e.g., wrong stop index using "for" iteration) in CAIE's mark schemes

If my codes can help you to gain A or A*

It will be a fantistic thing!

If you think there are bugs/other issues, or you have any advice, please do not hesitate to reflect them!
