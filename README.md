This repository offers unofficial Python solution code to  Paper 4 of the [Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science (9618)](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-computer-science-9618/) exam. It corrects obvious mistakes in mark scheme, e.g. incorrect syntax and undefined variables. All code and input data file names strictly follow the question paper instructions.

## FAQs

#### _Why some parts of the code differ from the official mark scheme?_

My code might uses a another approach, which is also considered correct. Mark schemes from different exam seasons give distinct example codes to the same question, so it is hard to find a "best" approach.

If this is not the case, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/strongdingstar/9618/issues) and I will fix it.

#### _What does `9618_s21_qp_41=42=43` mean? What is the `=` sign for?_

Because paper 41, 42, and 43 of that exam season are identical. I use `=` signs in folder names to avoid redundancy.

#### _When running the code in vscode, `no such file or directory` error raises?_

Please look for `python.terminal.executeInFileDir` in settings and change its value to `true`.

#### _Where are the question papers and supporting files?_

You could find them [here](https://papers.gceguide.net/A%20Levels/Computer%20Science%20(for%20first%20examination%20in%202021)%20(9618)/).

#### _How do I report a bug or mistake?_

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/strongdingstar/9618/issues).

## Future Plans

- Update solution code as soon as new question papers are released
- Add explaining comments to help learners understand
